# Actyx Pond

The Actyx Pond vscode extension will power up your development speed dramatically. Create new fishes in seconds, export types and define your commands and events from a high-level syntax.

## Features

This extension contributes fore new commands:

* `Actyx: new fish`: overwrite the current file with a new fish definition
* `Actyx: export fish`: export the fish definition in the index.ts with aliases.
* `Actyx: create events`: convert the **selected** events to an event definition and add it to the onEvent function
* `Actyx: create commands`: convert the **selected** command to a command definition and add it to the onCommand function

## Demo

### `Actyx: new fish`: Create a new fish definition

Open a new file and run the `Actyx: new fish` in `Ctrl+Shift+P` or press `Alt+A N`. VS-Code opens a Popup and asks you for a fish name and try to overwrite the content of the active document. To avoid conversions, use a fish name like `/[a-z_]/i`

### `Actyx: create events`: Define events for the fish

An event is the communication channel for the distributed system to share facts between the edge nodes. To build on a type save infrastructure, some type definitions are required. To reduce the amount of typing code, the definitions can be generated by selecting the definitions and run `Actyx: create events` or `Alt+A E`.

The syntax:

```typescript
// no parameters
eventName
// parameters
eventName(parameter: type)
eventName(parameter: type, para...)
eventName(
  parameter: type, 
  para...
)
// nested parameter
eventName(
  parameter: {
    parameter: type,
    param...,
  }
)
```

### `Actyx: create commands`

A command is the only way to communicate with the local fishes on your edge nodes. To communicate on a type save infrastructure, some type definition is required. To reduce the amount of typing code, the definitions can be generated by selecting the definitions and run  `Actyx: create commands` or `Alt+A C`.

The syntax:

```typescript
// no parameters
commandName
// parameters
commandName(parameter: type)
commandName(parameter: type, para...)
commandName(
  parameter: type, 
  para...
)
// nested parameter
commandName(
  parameter: {
    parameter: type,
    param...,
  }
)
```

### `Actyx: export fish`

In larger projects, is it very comfortable to Import your fishes and other definitions from a combined index.ts file. When you run the `Actyx: export fish` command, your current fish definition will be exported with alias referring to your fish (e.g: WorkstationFish => `WorkstationEvent`, `WorkstationEventType`, ...) in the index.ts file next to the definition. We recommend, to define all your fishes in a dedicated `fishes` directory to reuse them in any places you need.

If you like to define all your fishes first or you have already some defined fishes, you can run the `Actyx: export fish` command in the index.ts file next to the definitions. This will generate the missing `export` sections for all fish definitions.
